Whenever the Pico W starts it will first check if there is a USB cable connecting it to an Android Phone/Tablet. If there is it will try to connect to the 
Scoppy app on the Android device. If after 10 seconds there is no response from the Scoppy app on the tablet when it will try and connect via WiFi.

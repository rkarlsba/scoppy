> The FSCOPE-500K was previously known as the FSCOPE-250K. Both boards are exactly the same.

<br>
The [_FSCOPE-500K_](https://store.fhdm.xyz/fscope-500k) is a 2 channel oscilloscope analog front end for use with the Raspberry Pi Pico or Pico W and the Scoppy Android app.

### Assembly

You will need to supply:
- One Raspberry Pi Pico or Pico W
- 7 pairs of 0.1" male headers (or 6 pairs and 2 compatible BNC connectors)
- If the Pico is not to be soldered directly to the board (ie. it will be removable) then 
2 sets of 20 0.1" pin headers are also required.
- 3 jumpers (shunts)

#### 1. Input Connectors (headers)

- Solder pairs of 0.1" male headers to each of CH1/GND and CH2/GND (these can be found at the bottom of the board).

#### 2. AC/DC Coupling pins

- Find the pairs of holes labeled DC. Solder male headers to these and install a jumper (shunt) to connect the two header pins. When the pins are connected like this the channel is in DC coupling mode. Remove the jumper for AC coupling.

#### 3. Signal Generator output and low-pass filter

- Solder headers to the holes labeled 'SIG' (or 'SIG1') at H12 and optionally to the GND hole.
- Solder headers to the holes at H4.

#### 4. Trimmer Capacitors

- Solder the included green trimmer capacitors to C15 and C32. Polarity is not important.

#### 5. Raspberry PI Pico (or Pico W)

The Pico can be soldered directly to the board or via headers so that it can be easily removed.

#### 6. Input Connectors (BNC connectors - optional)

- The board can also be used with the inexpensive BNC connectors available from sites such as eBay, [Amazon](https://amzn.to/3HhM9zo) or Aliexpress. The footprint can be found in the datasheet [here](https://lcsc.com/product-detail/RF-Connectors-Coaxial-Connectors_dosinconn-DOSIN-801-0038_C709673.html).

- If using BNC connectors, solder them to BNC CH1 and BNC CH2.

### Firmware Installation

Download and install the Scoppy FSCOPE firmware. Instructions are on the [Installation & Getting Started](../wiki/Installation-&-Getting-Started) page.

The firmware file for the Pico is named scoppy-pico-fscope-250k5-vNN.uf2 and the file for the Pico W is named scoppy-pico-wireless-fscope-250k5-vNN.uf2 (where NN is the version number).

### Trimmer capacitor adjustment

>  If you have Rev. 2 of the FSCOPE board please see [FSCOPE-250K-Rev2](fscope-250k-rev2)

> __If using the signal generator on the FSCOPE/DSO board for the trimmer capacitor adjustment, ensure the jumper on H4 has been removed!!!__

Feed a 1kHz square wave into the CH1 input (using jumper wires or 1X probes - do NOT use 10X probes). If the waveform displayed in the app doesn't look square then adjust the trimmer capacitor (C15) until it does. You'll need a small screwdriver to do the adjustment. Screwdrivers like those supplied with oscilloscope probes should work.

You can use the Scoppy signal generator to generate the 1kHz square wave as follows:

1. If there is a jumper on H4 then remove that.
2. Connect the lower SIG pin (DIRECT) on H2 to CH1 with a jumper wire. 
3. You should see a square wave in the Scoppy app. Ensure the volts/div for CH1 is greater than 600mV (input voltage range 0) otherwise the signal might get clipped.
   
> See the usage instructions for more information about the signal generator pads on the board.
   
Repeat the procedure for CH2 (the trimmer capacitor for CH2 is labeled C32).

title: Firmware GPIO Settings
---

This screen allows you to specify the GPIOs to use for particular functions.
For example, you could configure the Scoppy firmware to use a different GPIO than 22 (the default) for the signal generator output.

<br>
Some functions can be disabled completely by setting the GPIO to _None_. For example, to reduce current consumption you could disable the
Pico's onboard LED by setting the _Status LED_ GPIO to _None_.

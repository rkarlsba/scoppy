title: Firmware Channel Settings
---

This screen in the app allows you to configure various channel settings (including voltage ranges) so that they are stored on the oscilloscope hardware (eg. a Pico, Pico W, FSCOPE-500K or DSO-500K).

When a connection is established between the hardware and app, the settings are uploaded to the app.

See the [Analog Front-End](../wiki/Analog-Front-End) documentation for information about these settings.

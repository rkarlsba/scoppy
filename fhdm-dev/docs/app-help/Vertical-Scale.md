title: Vertical Scale (Volts/Div)
---

There are a number ways that the vertical scale (Volts/div) can be adjusted.

<br>

### 1. Touch Gestures

Pinch and zoom on the screen vertically. The trace for the selected channel will be scaled.
The selected channel can be changed by tapping the CH1 or CH2 buttons in the Vertical section
of the control panel.

A channel can also be selected by tapping its ground indicator (the right pointing arrow at the left
of the screen).

### 2. VOLTS/DIV + and - Buttons

Single tap these buttons or tap-and-hold to change the volts/div for the selected channel.
